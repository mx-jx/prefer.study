Feels punitive, people should be able to be helped then and there rather than made to experience withdrawal to ""prove"" they want to be on the program. When you are withdrawing, they will start you on a painfully low dose that doesn't make you feel better.  People should be able to choose the dosage that they want, there does need to be a cap on what can be given straight away, but it seems out of touch with discomfort these people are experiencing.  If you stop requiring people to be withdrawing, then starting on a low dosage would make more sense.  Staff are condescending, the culture of the clinicians appears to be generally looking down on you and ignorant. Whether or not they mean to, often treat patients like they are stupid  Emphasis needs to be on respect for the client, trusting the client that they know what they need. ""guilty until proven innocent"" - you don't know what you need, you need to be fixed, you need to be told how to run your life, can't be trusted to administer your own drugs yourself ie not injecting your dose.  Takeaways - way too strict. Not being able to get them interferes with freedom and prevents people from living their lives as they want to and as they see fit. If people want to inject their dose, that should be on them. Comes back to the clinicians thinking they know better. Once you are in the system as a ""risk"" they will never trust you again.  Employees at dosing centres should be scrutinised as to whether they have their own motives or agenda when dealing with patients. Need to be subject to a character test to be able to treat the patients with dignity and respect. Same goes for the doctors - treat you like an idiot and as if you are less then.  Treatment should be free or at least included on the health care card. Price is reasonable for him, but not for everyone. On top of travel, all the costs add up.  Unisharp syringes - very hazardous: tips break off into peoples arm, very flimsy awkward to use.  In Cairns 'wheel filters' are not free, they cost $2/3 and you can only use them once or twice. Typically in Cairns people are injecting morphine which requires filtering and having to pay for wheel filters is disincentive to using them and this is very dangerous. In Melbourne they are free.  NSP vending machines often jam up or eat your money without getting your equipment. When this happens, people go to the counter in the hospital where they have a steady supply of needles and they will do nothing to help you before seven o'clock in the evening. This often forces people to use dirty equipment / share needles. This is out of line with 'harm reduction' policies. Hospital in Cairns is very discriminatory, dim view of drug users.  In a situation where the ambulance has been needed due to a drug-related incident they have made fun of the participant, treat him very poorly.",1,"Suboxone makes him feel ill.
